# Counterfactuals explanations
University of Bristol Interactive AI CDT first year module "Advanced topics in AI" coursework to research or implement one of the topics covered in lectures.

Using a toy data set I generated counterfactuals by:
- nearest neighbour to achieve the desired classification;
- minimising a loss function to find "the closest possible world", an approach suggested by [Wachter et. al][wachter];
- finding the shortest path in a density-weighted graph, an approach suggested by Poyiadzi et. al in [Feasible and Actionable Counterfactual Explanations][face].
